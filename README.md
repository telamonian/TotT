# TotT: Tip of the Tongue

## Install (JRJ)
 - Template is from http://django-edge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
 - Details are there, but I basically ran the startproject command with the template repo as an arg.
 - ** pip install -r requirements.txt **
 - ** cp TotT/settings/local.env.sample TotT/settings/local.env **
 - ** python manage.py migrate **
